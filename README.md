# myPassport

## Overview 
myPassport is a 3d visualization of which countries one can travel to 'openly' depending on which nation's passport they possess. 'Open countries' include countries that do not require a visa from a citizen of a given country, or offer visas upon arrival. For all other cases, including countries that require an approved visa prior to arrival are deemed ‘restricted’. The aforementioned information can be referenced at Visahq.co.uk and Passport Index.
